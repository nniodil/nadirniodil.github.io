Project Overview:

Nightland is a first-person shooter (FPS) zombie survival game inspired by Call of Duty's zombie mode. 
This project demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and implement complex gameplay systems and mechanics, providing an immersive and challenging experience for players.

Skills and Knowledge Applied:

Advanced Gameplay Mechanics:
- First-Person Shooter View: Implemented a responsive FPS camera and controls, offering a smooth and immersive player experience.
- Weapon Systems: Developed mechanics for wall-mounted weapons that players can purchase. Implemented aiming, reloading, and weapon switching functionalities, ensuring a dynamic combat experience.

Zombie AI:
- Coded intelligent enemy behaviors, including spawning, pathfinding, and attack patterns.
- Developed attack animations triggered when zombies are in close proximity to the player.
- Implemented different audio cues for zombies when they run or attack, enhancing the immersive atmosphere.

Round System:
- Created a system to manage zombie waves, increasing health as rounds progress to increase difficulty, challenging players to adapt their strategies.
- Health and Damage System: Implemented a robust health management system for the player, including damage over time and healing mechanics based on in-game items and actions.

Point System:
- Designed a point system where players earn points for killing zombies and can spend points on weapons, doors, and other in-game items.

Buyable Ending:
- Developed an endgame mechanic where players can purchase an ending to complete the game, adding a strategic goal.
- Restart System:
- Implemented a restart system that resets the game upon player death, encouraging replayability.

Technical Skills:

ProBuilder and Blender:
- Used ProBuilder to design the base map layout and Blender to create detailed window assets, learning and applying new software skills.

Map Design:
- Utilized ProBuilder for detailed level design, ensuring a well-structured and engaging game environment.

Script Optimization:
- Improved coding efficiency and performance through script optimization techniques, ensuring smooth gameplay.
- Independent Implementation:
- Successfully implemented complex game mechanics and systems independently, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills and self-reliance.

I did not create Assets other than the map layout.
